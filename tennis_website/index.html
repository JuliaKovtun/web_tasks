        <h1>Tennis</h1>
        <p>
            Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent 
            (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). <br>
            Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow 
            rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. 
            The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent 
            is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball 
            validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

<section class="history">
    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. 
        The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. 
        The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century 
        as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as 
        croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.<br>
        The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions 
        are that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and 
        the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis 
        has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, 
        which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.<br>      
        Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide 
        spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are 
        especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on 
        red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.</p>
